## 📝 Audit Logging

### Service: `auditService.js`

### Categories
```javascript
{
  AUTH: 'AUTH',           // Login, logout, auth failures

  INVENTORY: 'INVENTORY', // Stock changes, item management
  RECIPE: 'RECIPE',       // Recipe CRUD operations
  USER: 'USER',           // User account management
  PRICING: 'PRICING',     // Price changes
  SALES: 'SALES',         // Sales reports, analytics

}
```

### Audit Log Structure
```javascript
{
  id: number,           // Auto-incremented
  userId: number,       // User who performed action
  userEmail: string,    // Email of user
  timestamp: Date,      // When action occurred

## 🚀 Testing Checklist

### Authentication Testing
- [ ] Login with admin@restaurant.com / Admin123!
- [ ] Login with manager@restaurant.com / Manager123!
- [ ] Login with invalid credentials (should fail + log)
- [ ] Logout (should log audit entry)
